## Planning

### User Stories

- As an old user, I want a more simplistic design so that it's easier to read.
- As a tic tac toe fan user, I want something more original than basic tic tac toe so that the game stays interesting.
- As a middle aged user, I want something more retro so that it reminds me of an old arcade.
- As an artistic user, I want more themes to use so that I can change it whenever I'm getting tired of looking at the old one.
